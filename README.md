# Car Mileage and Diamond Price Prediction

Welcome to the Car Mileage and Diamond Price Prediction project! This project utilizes linear regression to predict car mileage and diamond prices. It includes comprehensive data analysis, relationship exploration, and visualization to provide clear insights.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will find:

1. **Data Analysis**: A thorough examination of the datasets to understand the variables and their distributions.
2. **Relationship Exploration**: Identifying and analyzing the relationships among different entities within the tables.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating various charts and plots to better understand the data and uncover patterns.
4. **Prediction Models**: Building linear regression models to predict car mileage and diamond prices.

## Tasks Performed

### Data Analysis
- Imported datasets related to car mileage and diamond prices.
- Conducted descriptive statistics to summarize the data.

### Relationship Exploration
- **Feature Correlations**: Examined the correlations between different features using a correlation matrix to identify strong relationships (e.g., car weight vs. mileage, diamond cut vs. price).
- **Scatter Plots**: Created scatter plots to visualize the relationships between key pairs of features, such as car weight and mileage or diamond cut and price.
- **Histograms**: Used histograms to show the distribution of individual features, helping to understand their spread and central tendency.
- **Box Plots**: Created box plots to visualize the distribution, central value, and variability of features, and to detect outliers.

All plots are accompanied by detailed descriptions in the Jupyter Notebook to explain the insights and patterns observed.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for coding, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning and linear regression.
